# sample-flask-app
This App is used to create a simple Flask App that will make me understand the end-end flow of creating conda environment.

To run the app use following commands in local:

* make setup 
* export FLASK_APP=hello 
* python hello.py

To run the app in docker and stop it:
* make run-app-docker
* docker-compose down
